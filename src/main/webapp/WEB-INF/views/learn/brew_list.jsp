			<div><h5>The Clever Coffee Dripper is one of our favorite brewers because it is one of the most accessible ways to make great coffee at home. This brewer requires very little technique, brews quickly, is easy to clean and produces an incredibly consistent cup. The Clever is designed to highlight the best aspects of both full immersion brewing and paper filtered pourovers. It produces the full, round body of full immersion brewing, similar to French Press, but has more flavor clarity and is much easier to clean. Hands down, the easiest way to brew better coffee at home.</h5></div>

			<div><h5>Designed by a German chemist in 1941, the Chemex is one of our favorite ways to make coffee. It's beautiful and distinct hourglass shape make it one of most beautiful brewers out there, but that’s not the only reason to love it. Our favorite feature is the thick, triple-layered paper filter that accentuates the clarity of the cup, enhancing brightness and nuance, while eliminating any body that could get in its way. Perhaps the cleanest cup coffee, it’s hard to beat this classic brewer.</h5></div>
